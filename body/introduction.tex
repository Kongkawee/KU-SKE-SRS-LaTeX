\section{Background}
\label{section:background}


Language proficiency, particularly in English, plays a crucial role in education and professional success. Vocabulary acquisition is one of the fundamental aspects of language learning, yet traditional methods such as memorization and repetitive exercises often fail to engage learners effectively. Many students struggle to retain new words due to a lack of interactive and immersive learning experiences.


To address this issue, Spell Splash was developed as a turn-based RPG educational game that integrates vocabulary learning into an engaging gameplay experience. By combining entertainment with education, the game provides an interactive platform where players can enhance their English vocabulary while enjoying strategic battles and immersive storytelling.


In Spell Splash, players navigate a fantasy world, encountering challenges that require them to demonstrate their vocabulary skills to progress. Through a combination of quizzes, word puzzles, and battle mechanics, the game reinforces word meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and contextual usage. This gamified approach helps players retain information more effectively compared to conventional learning techniques.


The rise of educational games has demonstrated their effectiveness in improving cognitive skills and knowledge retention. By leveraging game mechanics such as rewards, progression systems, and challenges, Spell Splash aims to make vocabulary learning more engaging and accessible to learners of all ages. This project seeks to bridge the gap between entertainment and education, making language learning an enjoyable and rewarding experience.
